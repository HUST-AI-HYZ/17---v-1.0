室外组别比赛要求：使用GPS, IMU, 摄像头, 光电管等一系列的原件作为传感器，在控制上使用MindMotion公司生产的32位MCU，控制一辆四轮越野车在室外场地导航前进。

我们开源了两种类型的程序，一种是有刷电机的，一种是无刷电机的，建议初学者们先从有刷电机开始。在传感器上，我们暂时只开源了使用GPS进行控制的程序。部分代码由于是学长提供暂时还不方便开源。

RT-Thread.pdf是我们组国赛的技术报告，暂时只有中文版本。如果各位有问题，请最好在issue中提交（尽快回复）或者直接联系作者。

Outdoor group competition requirements: Use a series of components such as GPS, IMU, cameras, photocells, etc. as sensors, and use a 32-bit MCU produced by MindMotion to control a four-wheel off-road vehicle to navigate and move forward on the outdoor field.

We have opened up two types of programs, one is for brushed motors and the other is for brushless motors. It is recommended that beginners start with brushed motors. On the sensor side, we have temporarily only opened up programs that use GPS for control. Some of the code is currently not convenient for open source due to being provided by senior students.

RT Thread. pdf is the technical report for our national competition, currently only available in Chinese. If you have any question about this project, you can send an issue or contacting with me via email.
